        #### 1st attempt
        After updating runProgram to update intcode[0] when the program starts with 2,
        the result I got for the updated value at intcode[0] was 273.

        The site says that's not the right answer. Trying again.

        #### 2nd attempt
        I had opcode-1 programs not storing their results in
        the right location which is intcode[array[3]]!

        Second answer was 103 and that's still wrong, so I'm still missing
        something…Trying again!

        #### 3rd attempt
        Ohhh, wait, I'm still hahahha I'm trying to store the result
        for opcode-2 programs at intcode[0], not intcode[array[3]].
        again! gah.

        A-ha! That was it! 3931283

        Okay, now to clean this up.

        #### After clean-up:
            - I decided to drop "else if (item === 99)". For one thing,
              if I ever wanted to change the halt code, I wouldn't have
              to update fixComputer _and_ as of now, we only want the
              opcodes 1 & 2 to work anyway.
